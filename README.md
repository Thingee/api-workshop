This was made for the [PyLadiesSF][pysf] [workshop][workshop] held on September 26th and 27th.

For installation instructions, check out the [install docs](https://github.com/econchick/api-workshop/blob/master/docs/PyLadies%20API%20Installation.md).

Hang tight, though!  This repo is just the initial code.  This will be made into a replicatable workshop.
